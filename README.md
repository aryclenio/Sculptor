# Sculptor drawer
  A sculptor that draws geometric figures in individual voxels (3d Pixels) and imports the figure to a .off or .vect format, readeable by geomview or meshlab. The image above shows the main window of the software. The square in the middle-left is the main matrix, known as our canvas. You can draw anything that you could imagine with it, painting small cubes in the combination of collors that you want.

  The Sculptor have 8 main funcionalities:
 <br>
 <ul>
   <li><b>Put Voxel</b>: Paint a small cube, at the size of 1x1 in the main canvas.</li> 
   <li><b>Put Box</b>: Paint a box, at the size that was set in the middle-right sliders in the main canvas.</li> 
   <li><b>Put Sphere</b>: Paint a sphere, at the size that was set in the bottom-right sliders in the main canvas.</li>
   <li><b>Put Ellipsoid</b>: Paint an ellipsoid, at the size that was set in the bottom-right sliders in the main canvas.</li> 
   <li><b>Cut Voxel</b>: Erases a small cube, at the size of 1x1 in the main canvas.</li> 
   <li><b>Cut Box</b>: Erases a box, at the size that was set in the middle right sliders in the main canvas.</li> 
   <li><b>Cut Sphere</b>: Erases a sphere, at the size that was set in the bottom-right sliders in the main canvas.</li>
   <li><b>Cut Ellipsoid</b>: Erases an ellipsoid, at the size that was set in the bottom-right sliders in the main canvas.</li>
 </ul>
   <br>
<p>All of these functions works just by clicking the mouse at the canvas, neddeing only to sellect witch one of the functions will take place.

<p>The group of radio buttons can change the view of the canvas. The matrix was build in 3d, but, to make the drawing easy, you can view it in 2D, and draw in the specific plane that you want.

  The software let you export the draw in two different types of files, a .OFF or a .VECT files, readeable by Meshlab (on Windows) or GeomView (on Linux) and offers a live view of the matrix in the last buttom, creating an instance of one of this programs, loading the file simultaniously.
<br>
View of the draw by program at left, and view by Meshlab, as an instance of the program.
